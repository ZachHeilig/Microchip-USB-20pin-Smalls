Breakout board for PIC18F14K50 (or PIC18LF14K50, PIC18F13K50 PIC18LF13K50).
Designed to fit into an Altoids Smalls tin

Issues:

  1) If you power the PIC with 5V, leave off the 3.3V regulator.  It will
     fight with the internal 3.3V regulator in the PIC (F version, not LF)
  2) You must solder a jumper from 3.3V or 5V to +V to power the PIC from
     the USB port.
  3) The USB D+ and D- lines are broken with R3 and R4, add jumpers to
     connect the data lines to the PIC.  D+/D- are shared with the PICKIT
     interface.
